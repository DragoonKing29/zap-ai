# Zap-AI: Advanced Weather AI with Autonomous Learning

Zap-AI is an advanced weather AI application built with FastAPI, integrating state-of-the-art AI and machine learning techniques. It can provide real-time weather data, solve complex mathematical problems, engage in conversations, and continuously learn from new data.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data:** Access weather information with integration from multiple sources and caching for faster response times.
- **AI Assistance:** Utilize cutting-edge AI models to ask complex queries involving advanced mathematics, science, or general knowledge.
- **Deep Learning Forecasting:** Generate weather forecasts using deep learning models trained on historical data.
- **Conversational AI:** Engage in natural language conversations with the AI, powered by transformer models like GPT-2.
- **Continuous Learning:** Autonomous model updating using reinforcement learning and online learning techniques.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional)
- OpenWeatherMap API Key

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zap-ai.git
    cd zap-ai
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    ```bash
    export WEATHER_API_KEY="your_openweathermap_api_key"
    export AI_MODEL_PATH="models/ai_model.pkl"
